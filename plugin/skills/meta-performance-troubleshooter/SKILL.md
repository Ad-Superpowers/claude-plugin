# Performance Troubleshooter

Diagnostic framework for identifying and resolving Meta Ads performance problems.

## Quick Diagnostic

```
WHAT IS THE PRIMARY SYMPTOM?
│
├─► No or low delivery
│   └─► Go to [Delivery Issues]
│
├─► High CPA / Low ROAS
│   └─► Go to [Efficiency Problems]
│
├─► Low CTR
│   └─► Go to [Engagement Issues]
│
├─► High CPM
│   └─► Go to [Auction Competition]
│
├─► Performance declining over time
│   └─► Go to [Performance Decay]
│
└─► Conversions not tracked
    └─► Go to [Tracking Issues]
```

## Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Check Fundamentals

```
FUNDAMENTALS CHECKLIST:
□ Pixel firing correctly? (⚠️ UI-only — no API for pixel diagnostics; check Events Manager)
□ CAPI active? (Server events visible?)
□ Event Match Quality? (⚠️ UI-only — EMQ score not available via API; check Events Manager)
□ Attribution window correct? (Match buying cycle)
□ Budget sufficient? (Min €50/day for learning)
□ Audience size adequate? (Min 1M+ for prospecting)
□ Creative variety? (Min 3-5 ads per ad set)
```

### Step 2: Ad Relevance Diagnostics

Meta's 3 ranking metrics at ad level:

| Metric | Meaning | Below Average = |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Quality Ranking** | Perceived quality vs competitors | Improve creative/landing page |
| **Engagement Rate Ranking** | Expected engagement vs competitors | Better hooks, more compelling creative |
| **Conversion Rate Ranking** | Expected CVR vs competitors | Landing page issues, audience mismatch |

### Step 3: Identify Root Cause

Use diagnostic matrix below per symptom.

## Delivery Issues

### Symptom: No or Very Low Impressions

```
DIAGNOSE: Why no delivery?
│
├─► Ad Account Issues
│   ├── Account restricted/disabled?
│   ├── Payment method issue?
│   └── Policy violation?
│
├─► Campaign Settings
│   ├── Budget too low?
│   ├── Bid/Cost cap too restrictive?
│   ├── Schedule issues? (Ads not active?)
│   └── Campaign paused?
│
├─► Audience Issues
│   ├── Audience too small? (<50K)
│   ├── Too many exclusions?
│   ├── Geo targeting too narrow?
│   └── Overlap with other campaigns?
│
├─► Ad Issues
│   ├── Ads rejected/in review?
│   ├── Low Quality Ranking?
│   └── Policy flags?
│
└─► Competition Issues
    ├── Auction outbid?
    └── CPM spike in market?
```

### Solutions Matrix: Delivery

| Issue | Diagnose Via | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Budget too low | Spend vs budget | Increase to €50+/day |
| Bid cap too low | Delivery insights | Increase 20-30% or switch to Lowest Cost |
| Audience too small | Audience size estimate | Broader targeting, remove restrictions |
| Ads rejected | Ad status | Fix policy issues, appeal if incorrect |
| Low quality | Quality Ranking | Improve creative, landing page |
| Outbid | Auction overlap | Increase bid or switch strategy |

## Efficiency Problems

### Symptom: High CPA / Low ROAS

```
DIAGNOSE: Why high CPA?
│
├─► Funnel Analysis
│   ├── CPM normal, CTR low → Creative issue
│   ├── CPM normal, CTR normal, CVR low → Landing page issue
│   ├── CPM high, CTR normal → Audience/competition issue
│   └── All metrics degraded → Multiple issues
│
├─► Funnel Metrics Checklist
│   ├── CPM: €[X] (Benchmark: €15-25)
│   ├── CTR: [X]% (Benchmark: 1-2%)
│   ├── CPC: €[X] (Benchmark: €0.50-1.00)
│   ├── LP → ATC: [X]% (Benchmark: 15%)
│   ├── ATC → Purchase: [X]% (Benchmark: 30-50%)
│   └── Overall CVR: [X]% (Benchmark: 2-5%)
│
└─► Identify Bottleneck
    └─► Focus optimization effort there
```

### Solutions Matrix: Efficiency

| Bottleneck | Symptom | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Creative | Low CTR | Test new hooks, formats, angles |
| Targeting | High CPM, normal CTR | Broader audience, less competition |
| Landing Page | High CTR, low CVR | UX audit, speed test, trust elements |
| Offer | Good traffic, no sales | Price, value prop, urgency |
| Tracking | Conversions missing | Fix Pixel/CAPI, check deduplication |
| Attribution | Sales in GA but not Meta | Attribution window, cross-device |

### Funnel Optimization Priority

```
PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix tracking first (no data = optimizing blind)
2. Landing page (often 2-3x lift possible)
3. Creative (highest ongoing impact)
4. Targeting (let AI help)
5. Bid strategy (fine-tuning)

ROI PER FIX:
├── Tracking: 50-200% improvement possible
├── Landing page: 20-100% CVR lift
├── Creative: 20-50% CTR lift
├── Targeting: 10-30% efficiency gain
└── Bid strategy: 5-15% fine-tuning
```

## Engagement Issues

### Symptom: Low CTR

```
CTR BENCHMARK:
├── Poor: <0.8%
├── Average: 0.8-1.5%
├── Good: 1.5-2.5%

│   ├── Wrong format for placement
│   └── Creative fatigue
│
├─► Targeting Issues
│   ├── Irrelevant audience
│   ├── Audience too broad
│   └── Message-audience mismatch
│
└─► Ad Copy Issues

    ├── No clear CTA
    └── Benefits unclear
```

### Solutions: Low CTR

```
CREATIVE FIXES:
├── Test 5+ new hook variations
├── A/B test headlines
├── Try different formats (video vs static)
├── Update visuals/thumbnails
└── Add motion/animation

TARGETING FIXES:
├── Narrow to higher-intent segments
├── Test different interest combinations
├── Create lookalikes from purchasers
└── Exclude low-engagement segments

COPY FIXES:

```

## Auction Competition

### Symptom: High CPM

```
CPM BENCHMARK:
├── Low: <€10
├── Average: €15-25
├── High: €25-40
└── Very High: >€40

HIGH CPM CAUSES:
│
├─► Market Factors
│   ├── Peak season (Q4, Black Friday)
│   ├── Industry competition spike
│   └── Major events/elections
│
├─► Targeting Factors
│   ├── Very competitive audience
│   ├── Small audience (premium pricing)
│   └── Overlapping with own campaigns
│
└─► Quality Factors
    ├── Low relevance score
    ├── Poor engagement history
    └── New ad account (no history)
```

### Solutions: High CPM

```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
├── Expand audience (larger = cheaper)
├── Remove restrictive targeting
├── Test different placements (including Threads — new March 2026, lower CPM early stage)
├── Check audience overlap tool

STRATEGIC ACTIONS:
├── Improve ad quality (better auction position)
├── Test off-peak timing
├── Build lookalikes from best customers
└── Diversify to less competitive channels

SEASONAL STRATEGY:
├── Pre-peak: Lock in audiences, test creatives
├── Peak: Accept higher CPM, focus on ROAS
└── Post-peak: Capitalize on lower competition
```

## Performance Decay

### Symptom: Metrics Declining Over Time

```
DECAY DIAGNOSIS:
│
├─► Creative Fatigue
│   ├── Symptoms: Rising frequency, falling CTR
│   ├── Threshold: Frequency >3-4
│   └── Solution: Fresh creative rotation
│
├─► Audience Saturation

│   └── Solution: Adjust expectations, test new offers
│
├─► Competitor Activity
│   ├── Symptoms: CPM up, CTR down
│   └── Solution: Differentiate, refresh positioning
│
└─► Algorithm Changes
    ├── Symptoms: Sudden performance shift
    └── Solution: Adapt to new best practices
```

### Tracking Fix Checklist

```
QUICK FIXES:
□ Test Pixel with Meta Pixel Helper (⚠️ UI-only — browser extension)
□ Check Events Manager for recent events (⚠️ UI-only — event diagnostics not in API)
□ Verify domain is verified
□ Confirm event parameters (value, currency)
□ Check for duplicate events

CAPI VERIFICATION (⚠️ all UI-only — Events Manager required):
□ Server events visible in Events Manager?
□ Deduplication working? (Same event from 2 sources)
□ Event Match Quality >7?
□ Customer parameters hashed correctly?

ATTRIBUTION CHECK:
□ Attribution window matches buying cycle
□ GA4 comparison (same trends?)
□ Post-purchase survey attribution
```

## Kill vs Scale Decision

### Decision Framework

```
SCALE SIGNALS (Increase Budget):
├── ROAS >target for 5+ days
├── CPA <target and stable
├── CTR above benchmark
├── Frequency <3
├── Room to grow in audience
└── Consistent daily performance

OPTIMIZE SIGNALS (Test & Tweak):
├── ROAS within 20% of target
├── CPA fluctuating but manageable
├── Some ads performing, others not
├── Creative starting to fatigue
└── Potential with adjustments

KILL SIGNALS (Pause/Stop):
├── ROAS <1x (losing money)
├── CPA >2x target for 7+ days
├── CTR <0.5% consistent
├── No improvements despite tests
├── Insufficient budget for learning
└── Audience exhausted
```

### Kill Decision Checklist

```
BEFORE KILLING, VERIFY:
□ Tracking is accurate (not a tracking issue)
□ Attribution window appropriate
□ Gave sufficient time (7+ days minimum)
□ Tested multiple creatives
□ Budget was adequate
□ Not during anomaly period (holiday, etc.)

IF ALL VERIFIED, THEN:
├── Killing = correct decision
├── Document learnings
├── Archive for reference
└── Reallocate budget to winners
```
